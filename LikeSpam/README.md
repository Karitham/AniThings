# AnilistLikeSpammer

Just a small utility to spam like a user on anilist

## Install

if you have go, the best way to install is just to `go get github.com/Karitham/AniThings/LikeSpam`

You can then use it by doing

`LikeSpam -user <Username> -count <count> -token <token>`

It should look like so :

```bash
LikeSpam -user Vitruvian -count 100 -token eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJS__REST_OF_THE_TOKEN
```

use `LikeSpam. -h` if you don't understand something
