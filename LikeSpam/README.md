# AnilistLikeSpammer

Just a small utility to spam like a user on anilist

To run, use as following

`go run . -user <Username> -count <count> -token <token>`

It should look like so :

```bash
go run . -user Vitruvian -count 100 -token eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJS__REST_OF_THE_TOKEN
```

use `go run . -h` if you don't understand something
